# Advanced-NumDetect-CNN
Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for numeric digit detection using Keras and TensorFlow. Follow the steps below to implement the project in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
tensorflow (includes Keras)
You can install these libraries using pip:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow
Steps to Implement the Project
1. Set Up Your Environment
Open Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

2. Import Libraries
Start by importing the necessary libraries:

3. Load and Explore the Data
Load the dataset and explore its structure

4. Preprocess the Data
Prepare the input and output data:

Visualize a sample image

5. Build the CNN Model
Create the CNN model architecture:


6. Compile the Model
Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss

7. Train the Model

8. Evaluate and Save the Model (Optional)
After training, you can evaluate the model and save it if needed.


# Evaluate model (use test data if available)
# model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)

# Save model
model.save('cnn_numeric_detection_model.h5')

Conclusion
This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to building and training a CNN for digit detection. By following these steps, you can implement and train your own model to classify handwritten digits effectively.
