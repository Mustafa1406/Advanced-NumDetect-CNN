# Advanced-NumDetect-CNN
This project builds a CNN for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Using Keras and TensorFlow, the CNN leverages convolutional, pooling, and dropout layers, trained with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. It effectively classifies digits, demonstrating CNNs' power in image recognition.
